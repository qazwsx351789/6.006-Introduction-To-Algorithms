All the Homework and quizzes are copied from MIT OpenCourseWare https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/ except ps1_sol.tex and some revised codes for the requirements in homework and quizzes.

My dictates for my answers or responds are all blue and red in ps1_sol.

I took the course 6.006 online and did all the homework and quizzes by myself as a practice. This course is instrumental for me to self-learn algorithms.
